# Data Schema – LinkedIn Suggestions Output

This document defines the structured output format generated by the **Social Media Assistant** after processing user progress updates.

The goal of this schema is to translate **unstructured user input** (e.g., spoken or written progress updates) into **actionable, section-specific LinkedIn update suggestions**.

---

## Overview

After receiving a user’s progress update, the system outputs suggestions for updating different sections of the user’s LinkedIn presence:

- Education
- Position / Experience
- Skills
- Public Post Content

Each section is independent and can be updated selectively.

---

## 1. EducationUpdate

Represents suggested updates to the **Education** section of LinkedIn.

```ts
EducationUpdate {
  shouldUpdate: boolean
  suggestedEntry?: {
    institution: string
    program: string
    duration: string
    description: string
  }
}
```

## 2. PositionUpdate

Represents suggested updates to the Experience / Position section.

```ts
PositionUpdate {
  shouldUpdate: boolean
  targetRole: string
  suggestedBullet: string
}
```

## 3. SkillsUpdate

Represents suggested updates to the Skills section.

```ts
SkillsUpdate {
  shouldUpdate: boolean
  add: string[]
  strengthen: string[]
  reason: string
}
```

## 4. PostUpdate

Represents suggested content for a LinkedIn post describing the progress.

```ts
PostUpdate {
  shouldUpdate: boolean
  tone: string
  content: string
  suggestedHashtags: string[]
}
```
